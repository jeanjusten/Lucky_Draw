<!--Automated Tasks-->
## :large_orange_diamond: Automated Tasks
### :arrow_forward: Grunt
This project uses Grunt to automate several tasks, such as JavaScript and CSS minification, image compression, and WebP format conversion.<br>
Check out some of the tasks in `gruntfile.js`:

* Minifying HTML file:

      htmlmin: {
          dist: {
              options: {
                  removeComments: true,
                  collapseWhitespace: true,
              },
              files: {
                  "prebuild/index.html": "src/index.html" // Creates a temporary directory for minifying html file
              }
          }
      },

* Compiling LESS:
  
      less: { 
          development: { 
              files: {
                  "dev/styles/main.css": "src/styles/main.less" 
              },
              options: {
                  livereload: true,
              }
          },
          production: { 
              options: {
                  compress: true, 
              },
              files: {
                  "dist/styles/main.min.css" : "src/styles/main.less"
              }
          },
